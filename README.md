# Flu-in-the-Northern-and-Southern-Hemispheres
## Does influenza A have a higher prevalence in the northern or southern hemisphere?
### Statement of Interest
We are interested in this question is because of the historical context of “third world countries” and the modern discourse on “the Global South.” The history of imperialism in the global south has led to the majority of countries being classified by international ranking organizations as “poor” and “developing.” Given this knowledge, it is valuable to consider how the health of people today is affected by their geographic location, and if it indeed corresponds to the historical exploitation of peoples and comparative lack of resources. Each country comes with its own history of infectious disease, and it will be interesting to see
how this develops into the current trends. Another aspect of this question is how the findings can show where the virus frequents and reveal more about its genetic disposition and what climate it prefers to proliferate in, allowing scientists to advance antiviral drugs and vaccines to combat Influenza. Additionally, this question is important given that the data we analyze can also be used to guide fund allocation for influenza treatment around the world. Like any other disease, influenza’s spread is highly relevant to the hygiene and economic conditions of different countries.
